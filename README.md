# OpenStreetMap Data Case Study
### Map area
Bali, Indonesia

Data source: [https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=10/-8.5342/115.1182](https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=10/-8.5342/115.1182)

This dataset is the map of Bali, one of the island of my homecountry, Indonesia. It's my top vacation destination and I am curious to explore the Bali data in OpenStreetMap and opportunites for improvement in the dataset.
